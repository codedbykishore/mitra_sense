## 🧩 System Architecture

MITRA follows a modular, service-driven architecture:

<img width="1698" height="2389" alt="MITRA Sense System Architecture (1)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1819e3a3-8f50-46f7-961b-6991629aa80d" />


Each component communicates asynchronously via REST endpoints (`/api/v1/*`) ensuring scalability, low latency, and reliability.

## ⚙️ Core Backend Services

| Service | File | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **GeminiService** | `app/services/gemini_ai.py` | Handles RAG-enhanced cultural conversations |
| **SpeechService** | `app/services/google_speech.py` | Manages multilingual voice processing |
| **RAGService** | `app/services/rag_service.py` | Retrieves knowledge from curated Indian wellness corpus |
| **FirestoreService** | `app/services/firestore.py` | Stores anonymous conversations and alerts |
| **CrisisService** | `app/services/crisis_service.py` | Detects risk patterns and escalates to Tele-MANAS |

All services follow strict async/await patterns with a **3-tier fallback system (RAG → Base AI → Crisis Escalation).**

## 💬 Voice Companion Architecture

From  :

```
🎤 User Audio → FastAPI STT → Emotion Analysis → Gemini + RAG → TTS → Playback 🎧
```

**Frontend Components:**
- `VoiceRecorder.tsx`: MediaRecorder capture
- `VoicePlayer.tsx`: Smooth playback with interruption handling
- `useSpeechLoop.ts`: Complete request/response loop
- `useEmotionTracking.ts`: Emotion scoring and visualization

**Backend Endpoints:**
- `/api/v1/voice/transcribe` — STT
- `/api/v1/voice/emotion` — Emotion scoring
- `/api/v1/voice/synthesize` — TTS synthesis
- `/api/v1/voice/pipeline/audio` — End-to-end audio → audio conversation
