# MITRA Sense — Feature 2.6: Frontend Integration for Chat History

## Goal
Ensure the chat UI correctly **loads and displays persisted messages** after login, across devices, and supports pagination.

---

## Frontend Requirements

1. **On Login**
   - Call `GET /api/v1/conversations` to fetch the list of conversation IDs for the current user.
   - Select the latest conversation (or allow the user to pick).

2. **Load Messages**
   - Call `GET /api/v1/conversations/{conversation_id}/messages?limit=50`.
   - Hydrate chat state with the returned messages.
   - Display messages in **chronological order** (oldest → newest).

3. **Pagination / "Load More"**
   - Implement a "Load More" button or infinite scroll.
   - Use the `limit` parameter to fetch additional older messages as needed.
   - Prepend older messages to the chat state to maintain order.

4. **Error Handling & Async Patterns**
   - Handle network failures gracefully.
   - Follow MITRA Sense async service patterns (`async/await`).
   - Display loading indicators or placeholders while fetching history.

5. **Cultural & Safety Considerations**
   - Preserve message metadata: language, emotion scores, source.
   - Ensure chat state remains consistent with privacy flags.

## Testing

- Verify chat history appears correctly after login/logout.
- Test across multiple devices to confirm persistence.
- Test pagination / "Load More" functionality.
