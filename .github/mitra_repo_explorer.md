Your task is to analyze the MITRA codebase and generate comprehensive documentation. ## Primary Tasks 1. **Repository Structure Analysis** - Map out the complete file structure and explain the purpose of each major directory/file - Identify the core services, routes, and data models - Document the relationships between different components 2. **Architecture Documentation** - Generate a detailed system architecture diagram (in text/ASCII format) - Explain the data flow from user input to AI response - Document the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) integration patterns - Map out the voice processing pipeline 3. **API Documentation** - List all API endpoints with their purposes - Document request/response schemas for each endpoint - Provide example curl commands for testing key features - Highlight cultural and safety-specific endpoints 4. **Cultural Intelligence Features** - Document how the system handles Hindi expressions like "ghabrahat" - Explain the cultural context detection mechanisms - Detail the family-centric approach and cultural sensitivity features 5. **Crisis Intervention System** - Document the crisis detection algorithms and thresholds - Explain the escalation pathways to Tele MANAS - Detail safety-first design patterns throughout the codebase 6. **Technology Integration Analysis** - Document Google Cloud Platform integrations (Vertex AI, Speech APIs) - Explain the RAG Engine implementation using latest libraries - Map out the multilingual support (English, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu) ## Output Format Generate a comprehensive README.md with the following structure:
markdown

## Special Instructions - **Focus on mental health context**: Always emphasize the cultural sensitivity and crisis safety aspects - **Include practical examples**: Provide real curl commands and usage examples - **Highlight unique features**: Emphasize what makes MITRA different from generic chatbots - **Security awareness**: Document privacy-first approach and anonymous user handling - **Cultural sensitivity**: Explain how Indian family dynamics and cultural expressions are handled - **Crisis safety**: Always highlight the safety-first design and Tele MANAS integration ## Analysis Guidelines 1. Look for patterns in how cultural context is processed in gemini_ai.py 2. Identify crisis detection keywords and escalation logic 3. Document the RAG knowledge base structure and cultural content 4. Map out the voice processing workflow in google_speech.py 5. Analyze the API route structure and response patterns 6. Document error handling and fallback mechanisms 7. Identify database models for privacy-preserving user tracking Generate comprehensive, actionable documentation that helps developers understand both the technical implementation and the cultural/safety mission of MITRA.
